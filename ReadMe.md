# Community Center Management System "HaMifgash"

A comprehensive digital management system for community centers, developed as a team project for Information Systems Analysis and Design course in Industrial Engineering and Management program.

## Project Description

This system was built using Zoho Creator platform to manage all aspects of community center operations including activity registration, participant management, instructor scheduling, payment processing, and attendance tracking. The project demonstrates practical application of systems analysis, database design, and business process automation.

## Technical Implementation

The system includes extensive custom programming and automation:
- **Custom Deluge Scripts**: Complex validation logic, duplicate prevention algorithms, and automated workflows
- **Database Design**: Relational structure with proper normalization and referential integrity  
- **Business Logic Automation**: Automated invoice calculation, payment tracking, and capacity management
- **Workflow Automation**: Registration processes, waiting list management, and email notifications
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Interactive charts and analytics with live data updates

## Key Programming Components

The system features sophisticated programming logic including conflict detection algorithms that prevent double-booking of instructors and participants, automated waiting list management when activities reach capacity, dynamic invoice generation based on participant registrations, and real-time balance calculations with payment history tracking.

## Files Structure

- `src/hamifgash-system.ds` - Complete system definition file for Zoho Creator import
- `docs/` - Documentation including user guide with screenshots and system specification
- User guide contains visual documentation with system screenshots and operational procedures

## Deployment

Import the .ds file into Zoho Creator to deploy the complete working system. The file contains all forms, workflows, custom scripts, user permissions, and dashboard configurations.

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of Information Systems Analysis and Design coursework, demonstrating systems analysis methodologies, database design principles, user interface design, and custom programming implementation in a real-world business scenario.
